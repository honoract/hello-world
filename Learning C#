This is my learning process of my first language, that is C#
I've picked C# because my goal is to become a Game Developer, and this language in my point of view is the best one

String interpolation

Code1
var name = "Honoract";
Console.WriteLine("Hello " + name + "!");

Code2
var name = "Honoract";
Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}!")

Code1 = Code2
If you add a $ before the opening quotes of the string, you can then include string values,
like the name variable, inside the string in curly brackets. Try it out and select Run Code.
Curly brackets -> {var}
You can code in both ways, but using the interpolation with the dollar sign($) makes the code easier to read.

Methods

Methods take inputs, do some work, and sometimes return a result.
ToUpper() is a method you can invoke on a string, like the name variable. It will return the same string, converted to uppercase.
