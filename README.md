# hello-world
My first Repository

My name is Gabriel Honorato, this is the very first time I'm using GitHub;
I'm Brazillian so I'm here to practice english and learn from scratch how this platform works in order to be a programmer futurely;
By the way, I'm 21 years old right now.

The goal of all this, is that me in the future can read and have a broad view of who was me.
The idea is to have a kind of "brain backup" of myself, in subjects related to coding, english, and GitHub skills as well.

So all I have to say is: Hello World! Hello Future Gabriel! This was you in July 2020 :)
Don't you give up bitch! Learn coding to be a Game Developer you mothafucka!!! You can do it!
